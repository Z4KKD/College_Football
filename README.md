# College Football Performance Analysis

This Python script analyzes college football game data to identify the best-performing team for a specific week.

## Description
The script loads data from a CSV file containing college football game statistics. It then filters the data for a specific week and calculates a performance metric based on the difference between home and away postgame Elo ratings. Finally, it identifies the team with the maximum performance difference and displays relevant information about that team.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Clone or download the repository containing the script and the CSV file.
4. Modify the `csv_file` variable in the script to specify the path to your CSV data file if it's different from the provided example.
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python college_football_analysis.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
Best Team for Week 1:
Home Team: Alabama
Away Team: Clemson
Performance Difference: 50
Excitement Index: 7.5
Notes: None
```
